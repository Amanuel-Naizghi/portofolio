        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>Throughout my 3-year-plus
            career as a software developer, I
            have focused on developing
            scalable and well-documented
            code. I enjoy working
            collaboratively but can also run
            with projects independently.
            Excited about the prospect of
            joining a product-driven
            company like Amazon.
